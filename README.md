# Sign Language Conversation

Welcome to the Sign Language Conversation project! This repository showcases an innovative application that facilitates sign language communication using two integrated machine learning models. These models are deployed on a Flask server, creating a seamless and interactive platform for sign language conversations.

## Overview

The project comprises two main components:

1. **Sign Language Recognition Model:** This model is responsible for recognizing signs made by users through a camera feed. It leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to accurately interpret various signs in real-time.

2. **Sign Language Generation Model:** Once a sign is recognized, the corresponding text or speech output is generated using this model. It transforms the recognized signs into meaningful sentences or spoken words, enabling a comprehensive and accessible conversation.

## Features

- Real-time sign language recognition
- Dynamic conversation generation based on recognized signs
- Flask server for easy deployment and interaction
- Integration of multiple machine learning models

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- [Additional dependencies for ML models]

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sign-language-conversation.git
    cd sign-language-conversation
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Flask server:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. **Open your web browser and navigate to** [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) **to start the sign language conversation.**
